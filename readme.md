# (original) Overview

Xeto is a data-only type system.  The name is derived from the phrase "eXtensible
Explicitly Typed Objects".  Xeto defines a simple plain text format used to
declare types and to exchange typed data.  It is designed to build and validate
[Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/) data models.  But Xeto is general
purpose enough to use with any structured data including CSV, JSON, or SQL data.

This repository is used to manage the source code for the standard libraries.

# Update 8/30/24
I just did a clone of this repository on a different machine and learned that I have not yet
fully understood how to push my changes up.  I am working on this today.  I'll post here
once I have learned how to do this the way I expect (still reading the git manual https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual)
Cheers - EnochRick

# Rick's Update 8/29/24
I forked this project for a couple of reasons:
1) I wanted to learn the github workflow, and put it into practice to learn how its done
2) I wanted to learn Xeto and be able to build and use it in axon
3) I noticed the GL36 example wasn't how I'd personally interpret GL36 to be used in Xeto, so i updated it and provided comments.

I hope folks find my changes useful! Cheers - EnochRick
