# (original) Overview

Xeto is a data-only type system.  The name is derived from the phrase "eXtensible
Explicitly Typed Objects".  Xeto defines a simple plain text format used to
declare types and to exchange typed data.  It is designed to build and validate
[Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/) data models.  But Xeto is general
purpose enough to use with any structured data including CSV, JSON, or SQL data.

This repository is used to manage the source code for the standard libraries.

# Update 9/5/204  [^1]
Today I spent some time trying to get my updated `G36SingleZoneAhu` spec to pass `fitsExplain()` on a test skyspark model I developed that should pass.  I think my model isn't done correctly as it's not passing the fitsExplain() properly. So I am going further into the model's various points indicated in the axon errors (see below)

  `msg:"6 errors"`
  
  `msg:"Missing required Point: ph.points::DischargeFanRunCmd"`
  
  `msg:"Missing required Point: ph.points::DischargeFanSpeedCmd"`
  
  `msg:"Missing required Point: ph.points::OutsideDamperCmd"`
  
  `msg:"Missing required Point: ashrae.g36::CoolingSignal"`
  
  `msg:"Missing required Point: ashrae.g36::HeatingSignal"`
  
  `msg:"Ambiguous match for Point: ph.points::ZoneAirTempSensor `

This has shown me that I need to keep working on getting the spec to be dynamic enough to accept the GL36 equipment types that fit a Single Zone AHU.  I must rethink how the spec checks the cooling/heating processes.  Right now I am just using a `chilledWaterCooling` tag, but a modern-day single-zone RTU could have VRF cooling/heating and this spec shouldn't balk at that.  Anyway, I continue to poke at this and refine my Xeto code.  Stay tuned,

_Cheers, EnochRick_


# Update 9/4/204  
I figured out the issue I was having yesterday with my testing setup in skyspark.  I modified my test procedure in [EnochRicksNotes](https://github.com/EnochRick/xeto/blob/master/EnocRicksNotes.md#my-testing-process) to correct the issue.  Things are now working properly again with this set of xeto files. 

# Update 9/3/2024
I wrote up my process and references in a note file you can find here: [EnochRicksNotes](EnocRicksNotes.md).  This includes detailed step-by-step instructions on how to compile your xeto files and bring them into your SkySpark environment for use and testing! Please scroll to the bottom to see my process step-by-step. 

I also  implemented the "choice" type for the cooling signal and heating signal which fixed the ambiguous match exception.  Furthermore, I made the call to version ph.points and added the specs for things that were previously in the `ashrae.g36/misc-points.xeto` under `ashrae.g36`.  

Added entries to the bottom of the following files in `ph.points`:
- air-pressure.xeto
- damper.xeto
- fan.xeto

`ph.points` has been versioned with these changed to v0.1.2 and the `ashrae.g36/lib.xeto` now requires this updated version. 

## Please Note
**I am having issues in skyspark that I am not having with the CLI axon.** 

I am working on it, right now be cautious with this fork and please realize it's a work in progress.  My issue is in my new ph.points version. It complies in CLI, but skyspark isnt happy with it.  Digging in, will keep you posted. 

Known Issues:

- [x] #1: Ambiguous types for : CoolingSignal and HeatingSignal ‚Äì I tried to set these up as OR types (trying to test how dynamic I can make the ‚Äúfit‚Äù function).  It throws an ‚ÄúAmbiguous match for Point: ashrae.g36::CoolingSignal‚Äù error when using the ‚ÄúfitsExplain()‚Äù.  This is likely my fault for not quite working this out per Xeto‚Äôs intended use of ‚Äúor‚Äù types. I now see I need to make them a "choice" type and reference the applicable entity types for GL36. 

- [ ] #2: SiteAirPressureSensor was created, and it's intended to be a ‚ÄúBuilding Static Pressure‚Äù type, but I didn‚Äôt see a tag in Haystack for ‚Äúwhole building stuff‚Äù beyond the ‚Äúsite‚Äù tag.  Not sure the ‚Äúsite‚Äù tag‚Äôs intended use fits what I did here.  

- [x] 3# The `misc-points.xeto` now has some types that could probably be merged into specific ph.points files, which would fit their intent and clean up `misc-points.xeto`.  I may make these changes to the source, but I am still testing the waters with this, so in the meantime, please ‚Äúbless this mess‚Äù üòâ

- [x] 4#: fix `ph.points` so local copy of skyspark can compile it (had an issue with my copy of the original repo, restored and this corrected my issue locally)

# Update 8/30/24 
End of day update: Moved a bunch of new types into the misc-points.xeto.  Had to define some new things to fit the Guideline's intent for certain control sequences (like building pressure control). 

Late Morning, Update 2: Figured it out, my new code is here now! 

Capt'n's Log: AM: I just did a clone of this repository on a different machine first thing this morning and learned that I have not yet
fully understood how to push my changes up.  I am working on this today.  I'll post here once I have learned how to do this the way I expect 
(still reading the git manual https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual)

# Rick's Update 8/29/24
I forked this project for a couple of reasons:
1) I wanted to learn the GitHub workflow and put it into practice to learn how it's done
2) I wanted to learn Xeto and be able to build and use it in axon
3) I noticed the GL36 example wasn't how I'd personally interpret GL36 to be used in Xeto, so I updated it and provided comments.

I hope folks find my changes useful! _Cheers - EnochRick_
